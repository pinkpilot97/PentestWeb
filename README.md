# PentestWeb
Vulnerable web application to practice your code review skills, developed in Express and React.

# Build

This project requires that you have docker installed

1. To build the docker images you must indicate the path where cloned this repository

```bash
WORKDIR=/home/user/path/ docker compose build
```

2. Validate that images have been created

```bash
docker images
```

3. Execute application services

```bash
docker compose up
```

4. To add initial data to the NoSQL database you must run a shell in the mongodatabase container. Once you are in the container the data will be added with the mongoimport command.

```bash
docker exec -it mongodatabase /bin/bash
mongoimport --db testdb --collection users --file /data/data.json
```

5. Enjoy. Happy hacking
